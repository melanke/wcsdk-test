This is a repository showing the problem that happens using wallet-connect-sdk-react with yarn.

If you install the dependencies using npm it will work perfectly, check the `npm-working-demo.mkv` file to see it working.
You need to open http://aero.coz.io to be able to test it (type any password when required).

When running via yarn it will not work, throwing this error:
> TypeError: utils_1.getError is not a function

Thank you so much for your help!! :)
